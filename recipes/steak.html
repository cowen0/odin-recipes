    <h3>A technique to ensure a great tasting steak everytime.</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Today’s recipe is more of a technique than a recipe – but it’s 
        one that all steak lovers should know because it’s <strong>easy</strong>, worthy
        of using on <strong>high quality steaks</strong> and also a way to really elevate <strong>
        economical steaks</strong>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thick cut steak
            <li>Butter
            <li>Garlic
            <li>Fresh Thyme</strong>
        </ul>
    <p>

    
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to bring to room temperature.
            <li>    Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels.
                <li>    Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot - you should see smoke!
                    <li>    Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the skillet.
                        <li>    Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 - 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn.
                            <li>    Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic and thyme. BE CAREFUL - the thyme will sputter!
                                <li>    Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it's cooked to your liking - 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F, chart below for other doneness temps)
                                    <li>    Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more.
                                        <li>    Rest: Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
                                            <li>    Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top. Pictured in post with Crispy Smashed Potatoes.
